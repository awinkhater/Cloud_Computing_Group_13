      <li>This is measured and derived wave data from data collected by oceanographic wave measuring buoys anchored at Mooloolaba.</li>
      <li>This data comes from Queensland Government Data - https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset.</li>

  <h2>2 EDA</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Correlation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The correlation between the significant wave height and the sea surface temperature is week.</li>
    <li>The peak period waves are tend to come from the east, which is a natural outcome as the western side of the observation points is land.</li>
    <li>The maximum wave height has a relatively strong correlation with the zero upcrossing wave period.</li>
  </ul>
