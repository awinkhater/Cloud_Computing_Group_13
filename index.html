  <h2>1.1 Correlation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The correlation between the significant wave height and the sea surface temperature is week.</li>
    <li>The peak period waves are tend to come from the east, which is a natural outcome as the western side of the observation points is land.</li>
    <li>The maximum wave height has a relatively strong correlation with the zero upcrossing wave period.</li>
  </ul>
