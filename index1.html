            <h1>Waves Measuring Buoys Data</h1>
                <p>Collecting wave data helps us understand how waves behave in calm and stormy weather conditions. This can be used to protect lives and property. For example, when a cyclone is approaching the coast, the data can be used by the Bureau of Meteorology and to Emergency Services to evaluate the potential impacts of waves on coastal communities.</p>
                <p>The wave information is used by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Planners and engineers in the design and construction of coastal structures and the investigation of natural coastal processes, including accretion and erosion.</li>
                        <li>Emergency services during the cyclone season.</li>
                        <li>Individuals, tourism and recreational businesses for planning of fishing or small craft activities.</li>
                        <li>Maritime organisations to plan port activities and to support navigational safety.</li>
                        <li>Large ocean-going vessels for calibration and verification of numerical wave models. These models cover large-scale areas and provide guidance and input to forecasts and warnings on the high seas for periods of up to 24 hours in advance.</li>
                        <li>Global wave modelling to improve the reliability of wave forecasting worldwide.</li>
                        <li>The Bureau of Meteorology as input to forecasts for specific coastal areas and up to 60 nautical miles seaward.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2> About the Dataset</h2>
                <p>We use wave monitoring buoys to continuously measure wave height, wave direction and wave period. As a wave monitoring buoy floats up and down each passing wave, its motion (or heave) is measured and electronically processed. Data from the wave monitoring buoys are transmitted to a nearby receiver station as a radio signal.</p>
                <p>We calibrate our wave monitoring buoys before and after each deployment. Normally, a wave monitoring buoy is deployed in the ocean for 12 months before it is then retrieved.</p>
                <p>This data comes from Queensland Government Data - https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>With an Adjusted R^2 of nearly 0.95, our regression model performs admirably at
                accurately predicting maximum wave heights in the future. Though the sea temperature is
                rising, we do not see evidence of wave height climbing dangerously higher from this forecast.
                This regression model performs well because of the stationarity of the dataset and shows that
                the maximum wave height is not showing signs of climbing higher than previous peaks.</p>
